# ðŸ”’ Protected Routes with Authentication (React + Node.js + JWT)

This project demonstrates how to implement **protected routes** that require authentication to access, using **React.js (with React Router)** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express + JWT** on the backend. It secures both frontend pages and backend APIs, ensuring only authenticated users can access restricted resources.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… React Router v6 for client-side routing.
- âœ… PrivateRoute component to protect frontend routes.
- âœ… JWT-based authentication (token issued on login, verified on requests).
- âœ… Node.js + Express backend with protected API endpoints.
- âœ… Middleware to verify JWT tokens and restrict unauthorized API access.
- âœ… Secure password hashing using `bcryptjs`.
- âœ… Token expiry support.
- âœ… Clean and modular code structure.
